SportsTracker Packaging
=======================

The project module 'st-packager' contains all the scripts and resources for
automated creation of native application packages and native installers during
the Maven build process.
It uses the JavaFX tool 'javapackager' (part of JDK 8) and the Maven plugin
'javafx-maven-plugin' (URL: https://github.com/zonski/javafx-maven-plugin).

The application packages always contain the required Java Runtime Environment
(JRE), so the user does not need to install Java manually before. This also
ensures that the application always uses the proper JRE version.

The native packages are not created by default, the Maven build must be started
with the profile 'native-packager'. This profile creates native application
packages and installers for the system on which the build is executed. The
created packages are located in the directory 'st-packager/target/jfx-native'.
Currently it's not possible to create cross-platform builds.

Execution: mvn clean install -Pnative-packager


Windows notes
-------------

Created packages:
- SportsTracker application
- SportsTracker-x.y.z.exe (Inno Setup, optional)

- Application packages are using proper name, version and icon.
- Packages should be created on a 32 bit system, so they run on 32 and 64 bit.

Native installer by using Inno Setup (tested with version 5.5.5):
- Setup before build:
  - Download and install Inno Setup from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
  - Add Inno Setup installation path to variable PATH
- Created Installer does not ask for SportsTracker installation directory, it
  installs always to 'C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\SportsTracker'.
- The Installer creates an entry in Start menu (proper name and icon).
- The Installer EXE is about 18 MB smaller than the zipped application package.


Mac OS X notes
--------------

Created packages:
- SportsTracker.app
- SportsTracker-x.y.z.dmg
- SportsTracker-x.y.z.pkg

- Application packages are using proper name, version and icon.
- The app icon must be in .icns format, conversion was done by using the web
  service http://iconverticons.com
- Mac application packages can also be created with the tool 'appbundler', but
  it is deprecated and replaced by the 'javapackager'.
